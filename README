KNOWN ISSUES

XWLE_TEXT events on Linux only generate ASCII equivalent Unicode values.
Lighttpd (1.4.10) on Windows sometimes sends the wrong-content length.

Tested with Apache 2.2.9, nginx 1.1.8

NOTE: It is very important precache.py is executed on a unix-based platform when generating precache.list for unix platforms to maintain file permissions

BUILDING

The code should successfully build under Linux, Windows, and Mac OSX 10.6.x+
It uses the Premake build system (http://industriousone.com/premake) which allows me enough control while balancing maintenance of the premake script.
Simply run premake4 from the command line to generate your favorite project files.

I have tested the following project files under the respective OS.
	Linux
	* Dependencies: mesa-common-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
	premake4 codeblocks

	Mac OSX
	premake4 xcode3

	Windows
	premake4 vs2008
	* You may need to clear the entry point from the visual studio project properties so it does not look for "mainCRTStartup".
	This appears to be a bug in the current version of Premake4.


CUSTOMIZATION

By editing include/vars.h; you can adjust some variables for precache such as the URL, Window title, etc.

Application icon: edit the file pertaining to the associated platform. 
	You can create new icons using png2ico (Windows), Icon Composer (Mac OSX). 
	Simply replace the file and build the binary again.

	Windows:
		resources/precache.ico
		
	Mac OSX:
		resources/precache.icns
		

Configuration file example:

This is a simple config used to specify variables to precache. This assumes an application is for a single platform.
install_path: The folder to place downloaded content (on a user's machine)
remote_project_path: The path on the remote server where the content will be hosted (relative to the root of the server).
	In this example, if precache pointed to "http://localhost", then files should be located in "http://localhost/build1234/"
local_project_path: Used for generating precache.list; the folder, on your deployment machine which runs precache.py, where the application content root is.
	In this example: "project" is a folder which contains "precache.conf", and a folder: "deploy". Deploy is used as a root for content.
excludes: A list of ignores that are applied when walking the local_project_path

----------------
{
	"install_path" : "appname",
	"remote_project_path" : "build1234",
	"local_project_path" : "deploy",
	
	"excludes" : 
	[
		"*.dSYM/*",
		"*.DS_Store"
	]
}
----------------


Here is another configuration file which is platform aware - meaning it only syncs the binaries for that platform.

deploy contains a folder "bin", which contains three folders, one for each platform "windows", "linux", "macosx".

binary_path: Used in this example to specify a binary root path which all binaries are synced to on the local machine. 
	It is needed because relative paths are resolved and would ordinarily be placed in the paths listed in "binaries". 
	Instead, we want them to appear in a more generic "bin" folder inside our project folder.
----------------	
{
	"install_path" : "appname",
	"remote_project_path" : "build1234",
	"local_project_path" : "deploy",
	"binary_path" : "bin",
	
	"excludes" : 
	[
		"*.dSYM/*",
		"*.DS_Store"
	],
	
	"binaries" :
	{
		"windows" : "bin/windows"
		"linux" : "bin/linux",
		"macosx" : "bin/macosx"
	}
}
