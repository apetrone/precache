KNOWN ISSUES

XWLE_TEXT events on Linux only generate ASCII equivalent Unicode values.

BUILDING

The code should successfully build under Linux, Windows, and Mac OSX 10.6.x+
It uses the Premake build system (http://industriousone.com/premake) which allows me enough control while balancing maintenance of the premake script.
Simply run premake4 from the command line to generate your favorite project files.

I have tested the following project files under the respective OS.
	Linux
	premake4 codeblocks

	Mac OSX
	premake4 xcode3

	Windows
	premake4 vs2008
