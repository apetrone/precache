KNOWN ISSUES

XWLE_TEXT events on Linux only generate ASCII equivalent Unicode values.
Lighttpd (1.4.10) on Windows sometimes sends the wrong-content length.

BUILDING

The code should successfully build under Linux, Windows, and Mac OSX 10.6.x+
It uses the Premake build system (http://industriousone.com/premake) which allows me enough control while balancing maintenance of the premake script.
Simply run premake4 from the command line to generate your favorite project files.

I have tested the following project files under the respective OS.
	Linux
	* Dependencies: mesa-common-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
	premake4 codeblocks

	Mac OSX
	premake4 xcode3

	Windows
	premake4 vs2008
	* You may need to clear the entry point from the visual studio project properties so it does not look for "mainCRTStartup".
	This appears to be a bug in the current version of Premake4.


CUSTOMIZATION

By editing include/vars.h; you can adjust some variables for precache such as the URL, Window title, etc.

Application icon: edit the file pertaining to the associated platform. 
	You can create new icons using png2ico (Windows), Icon Composer (Mac OSX). 
	Simply replace the file and build the binary again.

	Windows:
		resources/precache.ico
		
	Mac OSX:
		resources/precache.icns
		

Sample configuration file:
{	
	"target_path" : "./build",
	"basename" : "project_name",
	
	"excludes" : 
	[
		"*bin/*",
		"*obj/*",
		"*logs/*",
		"*.pch",
		"*.ipch",
		"*.conf",
		"*.pdb",
		"*.ilk",
		"*.sdf",
		"*.sln",
		"*.suo",
		"*.vcproj",
		"*.vcxproj"
	],
	
	"map" :
	{
		"windows" :
		{
			"bin/x64/windows/file.exe" : "bin/x64/file.exe",
			"bin/x86/windows/file.exe" : "bin/x86/file.exe"
		},
		
		"linux" : 
		{
			"bin/x64/linux/file" : "bin/x64/file",
			"bin/x86/linux/file" : "bin/x86/file"
		},
		
		"macosx" :
		{
			"bin/x64/macosx/file.app" : "bin/x64/file.app",
			"bin/x86/macosx/file.app" : "bin/x86/file.app"
		}
	}
}
